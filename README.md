# Life in Weeks

This web page was inspired by a post on [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
It's just a counter of my (most-likely) remaining weeks on this planet. `#sad`

Ultimately, I'll add an option for anybody to weep about her life.

This is a motivational project, of sorts: life is short, work on stuff that you like.

Others projects like this one exist, such as [LifeMeter](https://github.com/codekitchen/LifeMeter) by @codekitchen,
so I guess this was also an attempt to use [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
on my [docker container](https://github.com/thomascharbonnel/docker-jruby-torquebox4).
